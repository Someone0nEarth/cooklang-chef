A CLI utility to manage your cooklang recipes.

Install it with[^1]:
```sh
cargo install cooklang-chef
```

[^1]: This method currently has a problem. A dependency has a bug which is solved
but pending a release. Until then error colors won't work. If that is a big
problem for you, manually [cloning the repo and compiling will work](./docs/cli.md#compiling-the-cli).
